## Cross-cutting Learnings

### Prompting tips
- The more specific context you give Cursor (hypotheses, sector nuance, competitive dynamics), the higher quality the output
- Always review the peer set before publishing — incorrect peers undermine credibility instantly

### Data gathering
- Journey map content must be 100% voice-of-customer (G2, Gartner Peer Insights, Reddit, Trustpilot) — never financial metrics or investor language
- Each peer needs a named methodology note explaining how NRR was sourced or implied — this is what makes the benchmarking credible
- Target the most recent earnings call quotes (< 6 months old) — stale quotes undermine trust

### Quality assurance
- Always run the "skeptical client review" pass before publishing — read as the client's VP of Customer Success and challenge anything generic, unsupported, or wrong
- Generic journey findings ("good product, some competition") are the #1 quality issue — every finding needs to reference a real platform, reviewer, or review theme
