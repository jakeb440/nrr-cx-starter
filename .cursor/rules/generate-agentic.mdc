# Generate Agentic Customer Ops Teardown

When the user asks to generate an Agentic CX Teardown, follow this process.

## What It Includes

Reference: https://n-eight-zeta.vercel.app/

1. **Research Overview** — Headline thesis with 4 supporting stats (sourced), 4 key findings
2. **Customer Success** — Key insight, 3 stats, 3 operational motions (Enterprise/Strategic, Mid-Market, Scaled/Digital) each with disruption level and affected roles
3. **Professional Services** — Key insight, 3 stats, 3 operational motions (Implementation, Solution Design, Customer Education) with disruption levels and roles
4. **Support** — Key insight, 3 stats, 3 operational motions (First Response, Technical Resolution, Strategic Advisory) with disruption levels and roles
5. **Agentic Capabilities Framework** — 12 capabilities mapped across 9 operational motions with maturity (Available Now / Emerging / 12-18 Months)

## How It Differs from NRR CX

- No NRR benchmark or financial waterfall
- Focus is on operating model transformation, not revenue retention metrics
- Role-by-role impact analysis (which roles get elevated, restructured, or displaced)
- Forward-looking (what the company should do) vs diagnostic (where they stand)

## Data Gathering

### Research Phase
- Identify the target company's customer operations org (CS, PS, Support headcount and structure)
- Research the company's public AI/automation investments in customer ops
- Find competitor examples of agentic transformation (ServiceNow, Snowflake, CrowdStrike, etc.)
- Gather stats from Gartner, Forrester, and company earnings calls

### Per Function (CS, PS, Support)
- Identify 3 operational motions per function
- Rate disruption level: High or Moderate
- List 3-5 affected roles per motion
- Write a key insight paragraph
- Find 3 relevant stats with sources

### Capabilities Framework
- Map 12 agentic capabilities (from the reference site)
- For each: name, maturity level, description, which motions it impacts
- Customize to the target company (which capabilities matter most for them)

## Output Structure

Generate a Next.js app in `output/agentic-cx-{client}/` using `templates/agentic/` as the base.

Client data goes in `public/data/client-data.json`:

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Stats are sourced (company name, survey name, or "industry analyst estimates")
- [ ] Disruption levels are justified (High = fundamental role change, Moderate = augmentation)
- [ ] Capabilities framework covers all 9 operational motions
- [ ] Key insights are specific to the target company, not generic
- [ ] Roles listed are actual job titles used at the target company or industry
- [ ] Maturity levels reflect actual market readiness (not aspirational)
